This script requires two packages: dplyr and reshape2.
The text documents that comprise the raw data were first read with Notepad++ to get an idea of the data contained.
They were then read into R and combined in the appropriate fashion.
Features.txt was used for the column names.
The required columns selected and variable names adjusted.
The columns were ordered the mean of the variables determined.
The tidydata set was constructed.
