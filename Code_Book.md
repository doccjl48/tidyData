#CODE BOOK
This analysis is based on the original data: Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Dataset.
It was modified by combining the test and training groups.
The activities were given text names rather than code numbers.
A selection was made from the original list of measurements and a mean was determined for each of the 30 subjects for each of the 6 activities.
A 180x81 data table is presented with this final analysis
